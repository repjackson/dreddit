for the first time in a while the road ahead seems clear.  i can work with chiraya on the online classes app, which i think should be an extension of the gold run world.  we can build her thing out too but inevitably i think the benefit would be combining the local concept.  and if i'm building out a custom enterprise product for gr then ideally they would meet.  so software that manages the community and connects people.  a lot of things to handle but it's full spectrum.  feels good, and only recently would i have the confidence to see that plan.  i can also make progress on that front without having to feel like i'm stuck.  

talked with tanner, makes sense that he would be able to add things and then sell them.  should probably set that up.  creating a gold run marketplace is key.
